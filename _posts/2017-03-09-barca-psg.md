Yesterday's madness at the Nou Camp reminded me of [this paper](http://homedev.business.utah.edu/u0908787/papers/LuckSkillGames.pdf) from Scott Page and [Nathan Seegert](http://homedev.business.utah.edu/u0908787/).

Essentially, the balance of skill in a competition determines the teams' preferences for the role of skill in the match. A good team facing a bad team only looses if they are unlucky, and, therefore, wants to limit luck as much as possible. At the same time the worse team isn't worse off if they are unlucky, because they expected to loose, and can only win if they are lucky. It's easy to see Guardiola's Barcalona as a clear example of this strategy. A strategy based on safe, controlled, 10-yard passes to uncover a high-quality shot, allowed Barcelona to minimize the role of luck in their, often lopsided ([possession, goals, quality of supporters, etc](https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/mar/16/barcelona-v-arsenal-champions-league-last-16-live)), matches.

Yesterday, down four nil at home, Luis Enrique set Barcalona up for luck, while Unai Emery set PSG up for as little luck ... and football as possible.
