The excellent, if ephemeral, podcast [Sources & Methods](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/) has an interview with [Lynne Kelly](http://www.lynnekelly.com.au/) about her new book [_The Memory Code: The Traditional Aboriginal Memory Technique That Unlocks the Secrets of Stonehenge, Easter Island and Ancient Monuments the World Over_](http://www.lynnekelly.com.au/the-memory-code/), and it's companion volume [Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies](http://www.lynnekelly.com.au/knowledge-and-power-in-prehistoric-societies/).

[The interview](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/sources-and-methods-34-lynne-kelly) is one of Alex and Matt's best, and I recommend you hunt it down. I've just [ordered the book on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Memory-Code-Secrets-Stonehenge-Monuments/dp/1681773252/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) and here is why:
 1. I love old stories and thinking about prehistoric systems of belief and society. As an undergrad I became obsessed with Slavic belief systems before the [baptism of Rus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Kievan_Rus%27). My senior thesis investigated the information about these beliefs that survives in Russian swearing. It seems that the Russian Orthodox Church replaced the liturgical language of the oral tradition that was in place in 10th century Rus' with neologisms and Greek cognates, and redefined the liturgical lexicon as swearing. One of the very many ways to express 'F-word' in Russian comes from the name of a the pre-Christian slavic fertility god Yebalo. Which is a bit of a tangent, but this is a book about these stories.
 2. I've been using the [Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com/) method to learn Italian, and one of the key ideas is the use of mnemonic devices, the more ribald and graphic the better, to make memorization of vocabulary ... well memorable. When I heard Lynn describe these ancient stories as mnemonic devices particularly effective for their tendency toward the graphic and memorable detail I realized that the techniques I've been using for language learning, thinking they were new, were in fact quite old.
